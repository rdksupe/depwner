# PNB Hackathon Pwnedraccoon

This is powered by Electron.js to build a cross platform yet native app for various platforms- Windows, Linux, Mac and more. The frontend is made with SvelteKit with adapter-static to prerender it to plain HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS which electron can then use. The backend is made on NodeJS by the APIs provided by Electron.js itself.

For setting the download env locally-

1. Clone the project locally
   ```sh
   # for http clone
   git clone "https://github.com/code-IM-perfect/pwnedraccoons-depwner.git"
   # for ssh authentication
   git clone git@github.com:code-IM-perfect/pwnedraccoons-depwner.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies contained in `package.json` with npm
   ```sh
   cd pwnedraccoons-depwner && npm install
   ```

## Development

For previewing changes with hot reloading (on browser) you can use the dev script

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Electron

For previewing the native app generated by electron, run (make sure to build the project first tho, details below)

```sh
electron .
```

This takes files from the `build` directory, so make sure to build the project every time your app source code is changed.

```sh
npm run build
```

### Recommended way to preview electron app

We have included a convinience script, for first building and then previewing via electron, which can be used instead of both of the above commands

```sh
npm run build:electron
```
